 *
 *  @mainpage Welcome
 *  EasyLua is a sort of meta compiler and general high level API that resides on top of the normal Lua C API
 *  while at the same time remaining compatible with whatever existing Lua API calls may already exist in your
 *  software.
 *
 *  @section Support Supported Compilers and Operating Systems
 *  EasyDelegate has been compiled and known to run on the following systems:
 *  <ul>
 *      <li><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC 4.7.1</a> on Windows 7 AMD64</li>
 *      <li><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC 4.7.1</a> on Ubuntu 14.04 AMD64</li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  It should compile and run underneath of any compiler that supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_template">variadic templates</a>
 *  or has full C++11 support, though.
 *
 *  @section Performance Performance
 *  The performance of the EasyLua library should be comparable to that of using the Lua API directly if you are not using the
 *  high level tables interface. There is a runtime cost associated with certain corrections that the implementation has to make
 *  at runtime but the overall speed should not be overly affected.
